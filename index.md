# So, why another Assistant?
You would of course be thinking like, we got a whole
Lots of Assistants(Google Assistant, Cortana, Siri ,etc.
To name a few), then why this, why does it really matters to you?
The main reason for making of this was, "privacy",
Because that is a Nightmare if talking about some of these 
assistants, because you don't know what data they are taking from you,
And there is even a famous quote "If a product is Free by a big company,
Then understand that you are the product", but it is not in the case with 
Open-source because if you don't like anything, you can change it anytime
you want.
This also target Linux users(though it is cross-platform[can be 
Used on Windows, Mac, Or Linux]) because there is no Graphical Assistant there,
Though there are many great assistants for Linux but they are cli(command line interface). 

<b>So, that is why this project exist.</b>
